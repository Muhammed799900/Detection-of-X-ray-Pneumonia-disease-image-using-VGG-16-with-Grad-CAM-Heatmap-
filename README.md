‚úÖ Pneumonia Disease Classification using VGG-16 and Grad-CAM
Pneumonia is a severe and potentially life-threatening respiratory infection that primarily affects the lungs. It is characterized by inflammation of the air sacs (alveoli), which may fill with fluid or pus, leading to symptoms such as cough, fever, chills, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Pneumonia can result from various causes, including bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, with Streptococcus pneumoniae being one of the most common bacterial pathogens. The disease is particularly dangerous for vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, and individuals with weakened immune systems. Early and accurate diagnosis of pneumonia is crucial for effective treatment and reducing the risk of complications.

**üåü Deep Learning for Pneumonia Classification**
Recent advancements in medical imaging and artificial intelligence have significantly improved the detection and diagnosis of pneumonia. One of the most effective approaches is the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically classify pneumonia from chest X-ray images. In this study, we employed the VGG-16 model, a deep CNN architecture pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, to classify chest X-rays into pneumonia-positive and pneumonia-negative categories.

VGG-16 is a popular deep learning model known for its depth and simplicity, consisting of 16 layers, including convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. The model is fine-tuned on the pneumonia dataset to leverage its pre-learned features while also adapting to the specific task of pneumonia detection. The dataset was preprocessed to resize images to a uniform size and normalize pixel values. Data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustment, were applied to increase diversity and reduce overfitting during training.

**üîç Model Interpretation using Grad-CAM**
While deep learning models like VGG-16 achieve high accuracy, their predictions are often considered as "black-box" outputs, lacking interpretability. To address this, we utilized Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to generate heatmaps that visualize the model's attention areas when predicting pneumonia. Grad-CAM works by calculating the gradients of the target class with respect to the final convolutional layer, which is then combined to produce a heatmap overlayed on the original X-ray image.
These heatmaps highlight the specific regions of the lung that the model considers significant in making its predictions. This interpretability technique is crucial for validating the model‚Äôs decision-making process, as it allows healthcare professionals to assess whether the network is focusing on clinically relevant areas associated with pneumonia symptoms. Grad-CAM not only enhances transparency but also helps in verifying the model's reliability, ultimately supporting its integration into real-world clinical settings.
